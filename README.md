As part of my MBA 1A cousework, my team and I worked on Excel based data analysis project on a credit card company.
We handled a large dataset, applying pivot tables, slicers, dashboardsto extract key insigts .Our project focused on visualizing trends, customer spending behavior, and performance metrics effectively. This was a group project with three of my peers, where we collaborated to ensure data accuracy and meaningful interpretations. The project enhanced our data handling, analytical, and visualization skills in Excel. We applied the concepts taught in our UNP classes, gaining practical exposure to business analytics. This experience strengthened my proficiency in Excel for real-world financial data analysis.
